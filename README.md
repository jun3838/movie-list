# Assignment

I choose vue2 + vite + typescript as the base of the assignment, reason being that i'm familiar with vue2 + composition API, wanted to really get my hands dirty on official vue3. Vite as the bundler because vite was one of the new bundler leveraging lightning fast native ES Module providing very fast HMR (hot module reload), which is good for development, and developer experience. Typescript was the default for me as I really like what typescript provide as a synthetic type over native javascript. Also, i use tailwindcss as the the utilities class styling as i really like how easy you can layout and build UI really fast with all the base utility class provided by tailwind, and you can further customize it.

As you can see from the folder structure, assets hold all assets related file like product image, sprite for icons. I split most of the small functional part into small component so that it is easier to manage and the main file just wasn't that cluttered.

I also took the initiative to add search functionality to filter out product base on the search keyword, very simple approach, just to demonstrate how we could easily do searching from product list with vue reactivity.

Last but not least, I hope it meets the requirement needed for this assignment and looking forward to hear from you about my approach for this assignment.
